Hi there, 

this is my first try to properly organize my professional development
and have some metrics to track progress while sharing some research thoughts. At the moment of writing, I am in my third year of PhD. program at Rice University in the group for developing large-scale profiler [HPCToolkit](http://hpctoolkit.org/),
 that I will talk about much more later. Before I start my story, let me thank an amazing scientist and programmer [Chris Cummins](https://dejangrubisic.github.io/), for creating the template for this website and doing many other cool projects. Much more than that, reading Chris's posts, papers and code served as the great motivation, and guidance to organize me and be a successful PhD student.


The first two years of my studies at Rice were focused pretty much on the courses, that
served well to expand the starting knowledge and fill up some gaps but didn't really
move me towards publishing the papers and finishing my PhD. Since I am almost finished with
the required courses this semester, I had much more time to burn on reading the new papers and creating the plan for guiding further research and finishing PhD. The idea for a 
website came as a way to track progress and have a long-term repository of personal projects, suitable for applying for internships as well.


In future posts, I will tell you more about my background and the projects I have built so far.
